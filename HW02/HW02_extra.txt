Hi everyone,

Homework 2 is now available on Canvas. This assignment is worth 12.5 points and covers key topics from lectures 5 ‚Äì 7: Constraint Satisfaction Problems, Local Search (Minimum Conflicts), and Metaheuristic Optimization (PSO, DE, ACO).

üîπ Overview

Part A ‚Äì Sudoku as a CSP (4 pts)
Formulate Sudoku (9√ó9) as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem.
Implement Backtracking + MRV/LCV heuristics, add Forward Checking, and finally integrate AC-3 constraint propagation.
Compare runtime, nodes expanded, and backtracks across all variants.

Part B ‚Äì Minimum Conflicts (3 pts)
Implement the Minimum Conflicts heuristic for the n-Queens problem (n = 8, 16, 25).
Run several trials, report average steps / runtime, and discuss why this approach scales efficiently for large n.

Part C ‚Äì Metaheuristic Optimization (5.5 pts)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Benchmark Optimization (3 pts): Apply PSO, DE, or ACO to the Rastrigin and Rosenbrock functions.
Run at least 3 trials, explore multiple parameter settings, plot convergence curves, and discuss their effects.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Sudoku via Metaheuristics (2.5 pts): Use your chosen algorithm to minimize constraint violations in a Sudoku puzzle; report final fitness and runtime from 3 runs.
üîπ Submission Details

    Submit one AAAI-formatted PDF report and all source code.

    Include tables, figures, and convergence plots as shown in the assignment.

    Due Date: Nov 2nd. 

    Late work not accepted.

    Individual work only.

 

Please start early ‚Äî the optimization section may require some tuning to get good results.
Good luck, and I‚Äôm looking forward to your analyses!
